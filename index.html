        <p>Before we dive into Javascript, we'll need to make sure you have a few things in order.<br>
            This documentation page is only for you if:</p>
        <ul>    
        <li>You have a solid foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS. If these terms are brand new or foreign to you,
            this how-to isn't what you need. Don't worry! You can always come back, but you will need to study these topics before then. 
        </li>
        <li>You have access to a computer with a modern web browser and text editor.</li>
        <li>You have a strong willingness and determination to learn new things!</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="What_is_Javascript">
        <header class="sub_title">What is Javascript?</header>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
            JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control 
            over them. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
            and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. 
            Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.
             </p>
        <p> JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language interpreter embedded inside your web browser. 
            You can do anything in JavaScript that a regular language like Java allows. These include:</p>
        

             <p>It allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
                  information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, 
                  animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript 
                  is probably involved.</p>

        <header class="sub_title">Hello World</header>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, 
            open your code editor and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
        <code class="techdoc">
                function greetMe(yourName) {
                    alert("Hello " + yourName);
                  }
                  greetMe("World");
              </code>
        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        <p>You won't be expected to understand this code in detail immediately — we just want to introduce 
            you to the high level concepts for now, and give you an idea of how JavaScript 
            (and other programming languages) work. In subsequent articles you'll revisit all these features 
            in a lot more detail!</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header class="sub_title">Variables</header>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, 
            called identifiers, conform to certain rules. A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter,
             underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript 
             is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the 
            Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>With the keyword "var". Like this:</li>
        
        <code class="techdocvar">var x = 42.</code>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p><br>

            <li>By simply assigning it a value. Like this:</li>

        <code class="techdocvar">x = 42.</code>
        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript 
            warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>

            <li>With the keyword "let". Like this:</li>

            <code class="techdocvar">let y = 13.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.</p>
        </ol>
