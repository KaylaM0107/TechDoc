            This documentation page is only for you if:</p>
        <ul>    
        <li>You have a solid foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS. If these terms are brand new or foreign to you,
            this how-to isn't what you need. Don't worry! You can always come back, but you will need to study these topics before then. 
        </li>
        <li>You have access to a computer with a modern web browser and text editor.</li>

        <header class="sub_title">What is Javascript</header>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
            JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control 
            over them. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
            and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. 
            Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.
             </p>
        <p> JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language interpreter embedded inside your web browser. 
            You can do anything in JavaScript that a regular language like Java allows. These include:</p>
        

             <p>It allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
                  information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, 
                  animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript 
                  is probably involved.</p>

        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, 
            open your code editor and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
        <code class="techdoc">
                function greetMe(yourName) {
                    alert("Hello " + yourName);
                  }
                  greetMe("World");
              </code>
        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        <p>You won't be expected to understand this code in detail immediately — we just want to introduce 
            you to the high level concepts for now, and give you an idea of how JavaScript 
            (and other programming languages) work. In subsequent articles you'll revisit all these features 
            in a lot more detail!</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header class="sub_title">Variables</header>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, 
            called identifiers, conform to certain rules. A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter,
             underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript 
             is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the 
            Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>With the keyword "var". Like this:</li>
        
        <code class="techdocvar">var x = 42.</code>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p><br>

            <li>By simply assigning it a value. Like this:</li>

        <code class="techdocvar">x = 42.</code>
        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript 
            warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>

            <li>With the keyword "let". Like this:</li>

            <code class="techdocvar">let y = 13.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.</p>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <i class="fas fa-network-wired"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-download"></i>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header class="sub_title">Constants</header>
        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. 
            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: 
            it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, 
            numeric, or underscore characters.</p><br>
        <code class="techdocvar">const PI = 3.14;</code><br>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script 
            is running. It has to be initialized to a value. The scope rules for constants are the 
            same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the 
            identifier is assumed to represent a variable. You cannot declare a constant with the 
            same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p><br>
            <code class="techdocvar_med">// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
                    function f() {};
                    const f = 5;
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO
                    function f() {
                    const g = 5;
                    var g;
                    //statements
                    }</code><br>

                    <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following 
                        statement is executed without problems.</p><br>

                    <code class="techdocvar_sm">const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"};
                            MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>


    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header class="sub_title">Data Types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Boolean. True and false.</li>
            <li>null. A special keyword denotiong a null value. Because Javascript is case-sensitive, null
                is not the same as Null, NULL, or any variant.
            </li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>Symbol. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
            <li>Object.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although this is a relatively small amount of data types, they enable you to perform useful 
            functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements 
            in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as 
            procedures that your application can perform.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="If_Else_Statements">
        <header class="sub_title">If Else Statements</header>
        <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional 
            else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>

            <code class="techdocvar_else">if (condition) {
                    statement_1;
                    } else {
                    statement_2;
                    }</code>
                    <p>Condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of 
                        what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, 
                        statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested 
                        if statements.</p><br>
                        <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>

                        <code class="techdocvar_lg">if (condition) {
                                statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                                } else {
                                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                                }</code>
                                <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment 
                                    can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>

                                    <code class="techdocvar_else">if (x = y) {
                                            /* statements here */
                                            }</code>
                                            <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is
                                                 to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
                                                </p>

                                                <code class="techdocvar_else">if ((x = y)) {
                                                        /* statements here */
                                                        }</code>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="While_Statements">
    <header class="sub_title">While Statements</header>
    <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. 
        A while statement looks as follows:
    </p><br>
    <code class="techdocvar_sm">while (condition)
            statement</code>
            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the 
                    condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the 
                    condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p><br>

                    <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p><br>
                    <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p><br><br>
                 <code class="techdocvar_sm">var n = 0;<br>
                        var x = 0;<br>
                        while (n < 3) {<br>
                        n++;<br>
                        x += n;<br>
                        }</code>
                        <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. 
                            Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Function_Declarations">
    <header class="sub_title">Function Declarations</header>
    <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or 
        function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
        <li>The Javascript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {}.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square: </p><br><br>
    <code class="techdocvar_sm">function square(number) {<br>
            return number * number;<br>
            }
            </code><br>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one 
                statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by 
                itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p><br><br>
                <code class="techdocvar_sm">return number * number;</code><br>
                <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is 
                    passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this 
                    change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
